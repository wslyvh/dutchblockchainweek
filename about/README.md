# About

Dutch Blockchain Week is taking place from the 2nd till the 7th of June 2019 and is the first of its kind with events hosted not in just one city but across the country in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, The Hague and Arnhem, Tilburg and Almelo. 

Blockchain Netherlands, as the initiator of this week, brings together the Dutch ecosystem creating a truly community-driven blockchain week. They aim to connect, strengthen, expose the Dutch blockchain community to an international stage. What makes this Dutch Blockchain Week unique is that the program is completely created and organized by the community, thus offering a variety of topics, events accessible regardless of knowledge level and covering all types of organization in the blockchain space. 

Dutch Blockchain Week takes place in parallel to the world-renowned Money2020 conferences with a focus on innovation in the financial industry. The momentum that is created by the influx of thousands of international entrepreneurs, executives and regulators gives an enormous impulse for the Dutch blockchain ecosystem and therefore Dutch Blockchain Week.

Together with partners, such as BlockchainTalks, Lisk Center Utrecht, BlockDAM, Blockbar, Bitcoin Magazine NL a program is created that covers everything from fintech to regulation, from women in tech to social good, new economic models to technical deep-dives. At the moment, 15 events are confirmed to take place in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, The Hague and Arnhem. More events in Amsterdam, Tilburg and Almelo will be announced soon.
