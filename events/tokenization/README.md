name: New token models; How to create, evaluate and regulate them
synopsis:
  - As new models for digital assets and tokenization arise there are still a lot of questions about which token models are 'the best'. We will talk about various existin token models, what business problems they are solving and how they can be created in practice. Finally, the biggest question of all is how to deal with regulation. In this meetup we will hear about two different approaches to tokenization followed by an indepth discussion about even more token models, their added value and the role of regulation in this field.
  - We will start with a presentation by Gys Hough from Coinstone capital about his view on tokenization, the purpose of utility tokens and his picture of the future for the Coinstone fund. In the second presentation that we will hear from our hosts, Venturerock. Venturerock - represented by Marc Wesselink -  will talk about how they are going to change the way we fund companies across Europe. It is known that founders on average lose 60% of their time raising funds, cannot find the right talent to accelerate. On the other hand, professional investors are leaning more towards later stage funding and are often very localized. It causes a huge 'seed-squeeze' in Europe which is already lagging behind big time compared to US & Asia. We will show a new venture model based on equity tokens and why digital securities can help us to create a single EU venture capital market incl secondary market.
  - After introducing these two views we will invite various experts with backgrounds in investments, tokenization, regulation and compliance to talk more about token models, their unique characteristics and regulation.
