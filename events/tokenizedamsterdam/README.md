synopsis:
  - Preparing for the tokenized future of assets and securities.
  - This conference provides comprehensive insights on applying blockchain technology to the entire process of tokenizing a real-world asset and the creation of a security token. Tokenizing assets means lowering costs for issuers, but also improving transparency, efficiency and liquidity of real-world assets. The tokenization of real assets democratizes access to new investment opportunities and allows for fractional liquidation and ease of exchange with other investors.
